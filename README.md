- `Concurrency` is about **multiple things happening at the same time** in random order.
- `Concurrency` is composition of **independent execution compiutations**, which may or may not run in parallel.
- `Parallelism` is ability to **execute multiple computations simultaneously**.
- **`Concurrency` enables the `Parallelism`.**
- `Concurrency` is about **dealing with lots of things at once**.
- `Parallelism` is about **doing lots of things at once**.
- `Concurrency` is about **structure** and `Parallelism` is about **execution**.
